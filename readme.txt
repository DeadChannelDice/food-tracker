Multi-step final project from LearnJavascript.online.

The focus of the course is learning Javascript so the html, css, and API helper class are supplied by the course. 

This final project originally takes place in the browser code editor of the course but for more control and my own, flawed, internal sense of legitimacy I'm going to repeat the project here in VS.
